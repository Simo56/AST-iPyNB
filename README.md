## Overview

This repository contains code for a malware detector using a feedforward neural network implemented with scikit-learn. The detector is designed to classify PE Files as either benign or containing malware.

## Features

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for the neural network.
- **Scalable and Configurable**: Easily adjust the architecture and parameters of the neural network for experimentation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy and classification report on validation set for model evaluation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data loading, splitting, and scaling for effective model training.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The project is implemented in Python, leveraging scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

## Acknowledgements

- Tereza, Adeosun and Dominik for the help and effort we put in this project.
